A Shell Script to Monitor Network, Disk Usage, Uptime, Load Average and RAM Usage in Linux

The duty of System Administrator is really tough as he/she has to monitor the servers, users, logs, create backup and blah blah blah. For the most repetitive task most of the administrator write a script to automate their day-to-day repetitive task. Here we have written a shell Script that do not aims to automate the task of a typical system admin, but it may be helpful at places and specially for those newbies who can get most of the information they require about their System, Network, Users, Load, Ram, host, Internal IP, External IP, Uptime, etc.

We have taken care of formatting the output (to certain extent). The Script don’t contains any Malicious contents and it can be run using Normal user Account. In-fact it is recommended to run this script as user and not as root.

As soon as you run the command you get various System related information which are:

Internet Connectivity

OS Type

OS Name

OS Version

Architecture

Kernel Release

Hostname

Internal IP

External IP

Logged In users

Ram Usages

Swap Usages

Disk Usages

Load Average

System Uptime
